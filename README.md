# PAACDA-Comprehensive-Data-Corruption-Detection-Algorithm
18 datasets of varying sizes and corruptions were used to demonstrate the impact on the 16 different models with our proposed Proximity based Adamic Adar Corruption Detection Algorithm (PAACDA).


Indepth analysis of the 18 algorithms across the parameters accuracy,recall,precision score,sensitivity, and F1 score for dataset of small,medium and large datasets and varying levels of corruption is put forth in the following doc :
